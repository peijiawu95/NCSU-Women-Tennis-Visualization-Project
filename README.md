# NCSU Women's Tennis Visualization Project
Our team help NCSU Women's Tennis coach to build a visualization dashboard, which can present to the players helps drive development plans that are used to guide practice and schedule decisions. Highlighting deficits as well as sparking objective conversations about what is happening during competition.

# Goals of the project 
1. Create a cumulative stats profile for each NC State player based on the 17 metrics.
Visualize key metric averages for both season and career.
2. Create a team leaderboard for each stat to help visualize which players are stronger in
each area based on averages in each metric.
3. Create a stats profile for each player based on wins vs losses. Are we able to identify key
trends that are different in wins vs losses that might be predictors of outcome?
4. Visualization of trends over time for the key metrics for individuals. For example, can we
show a trend line of a player's first serve % over their recorded matches?
5. Visualization of trends over time for the key metrics for the team. For example, can we
show a trend line of a team's first serve % over their recorded matches?
6. Shows metric vs stats relative to indoor vs outdoor conditions. Are there significant
differences in any of the key metrics based on conditions?
7. Create a plus/minus ratio for each player. Using Bill Jacobsen Aggressive error margin
formula ((Winner + Forced Errors)-unforced errors)
8. Develop a First serve performance rating metric. Using Craig Oâ€™Shannessy formula of first
serve percentage multiplied by the decimal of first serve win percentage.
9. Develop a manual input interface for the women's tennis team manager to update stats and CSV real time as the season progresses. The goal is to create snapshots of trends as
the season progresses.
